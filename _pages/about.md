I am Armin Sadeghi, Ph.D., a software engineer and researcher at RideCo. I earned my Ph.D. in Robotics from the University of Waterloo in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Stephen L. Smith](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/). Before that, I completed a Master’s degree in Robotics at the University of Waterloo and earned dual Bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in Iran. My research interests include multi-robot systems, reinforcement learning, and optimization.
